## Short Introduction ##

The content management system _Blackjack_ was created after seeing so many other content management systems that were just too complicated. 'Why should I have this, this, and this in my software when all I need is this?' we asked ourselves. And, just like that, Blackjack started.

The important thing to remember is that this software isn't just for blogging- we plan on making this something you can use to manage your entire website, so flexible you will not once need to use FTP when managing Blackjack, but without all of the baggage that other CMSs may carry.

## So what do you have in mind for this? ##

Right now, we have a boxful of feature ideas, but all of these are going to be individually reviewed for practicality, usability, and '[Coolosity](Coolosity.md)'.

## Any way I can help? ##

Right now, our major focus is on squashing any bugs, which can be done through the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/b1ackjack/issues/list). Just open a new issue, and we'll take care of it as soon as we can.

You can also give (or get) help in our [Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/b1ackjack-discuss), or [read the wiki](http://code.google.com/p/b1ackjack/w/list) a bit.
